      <h1>Welcome to our Nutrition Page</h1>
      <p>
        This page is dedicated to providing you with information about healthy
        food products, supplements, portion control, mindful eating, and
        different dietary needs such as vegetarian, gluten-free, and low-carb

      <h2>Meal Plans</h2>
      <p>Here are some popular meal plans:</p>

      <h3>Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan</h3>
      <p>
        This meal plan is based on the traditional eating patterns of countries
        bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It emphasizes whole, minimally
        processed foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts,
        and olive oil, and includes moderate amounts of fish, poultry, and dairy
        products. Red meat and processed foods are limited.
      </p>

      <h3>DASH Diet Meal Plan</h3>
      <p>
        The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is designed to
        help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease. It
        emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat
        dairy products, and limits sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars.
      </p>
      <h3>Vegetarian Meal Plan</h3>
      <p>
        A vegetarian meal plan is based on plant-based foods such as fruits,
        vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. It may include dairy
        products and eggs for lacto-ovo vegetarians, or exclude all animal
        products for vegans. Vegetarian diets have been shown to have health
        benefits such as lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain
        cancers.
      </p>

      <h3>Gluten-Free Meal Plan</h3>
      <p>
        A gluten-free meal plan eliminates all foods containing gluten, which is
        a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It may include gluten-free
        grains such as rice, quinoa, and corn, as well as fruits, vegetables,
        and lean proteins. A gluten-free diet is necessary for people with
        celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
      </p>

      <h3>Low-Carb Meal Plan</h3>
      <p>
        A low-carb meal plan restricts carbohydrates, such as grains, fruits,
        and starchy vegetables, and emphasizes protein and healthy fats. This
        type of diet has been shown to be effective for weight loss and
        improving certain health markers such as blood sugar and cholesterol
        levels.

      <h2>Dietary Needs</h2>
      <p>Here are some tips for meeting different dietary needs:</p>
      <h3>Vegetarian and Vegan Diets</h3>
      <p>
        For those following a vegetarian or vegan diet, it's important to ensure
        that you're getting enough protein and iron from plant-based sources.
        Some good sources of protein include beans, lentils, tofu, and tempeh.
        You can also get iron from leafy greens, beans, and fortified cereals.
      </p>

      <h3>Gluten-Free Diets</h3>
      <p>
        For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, it's important to
        avoid foods that contain gluten, such as wheat, barley, and rye.
        Instead, opt for gluten-free grains such as rice, quinoa, and corn. Many
        packaged foods are now available in gluten-free versions, but be sure to
        read labels carefully to avoid hidden sources of gluten.
      </p>

      <h3>Low-Carb Diets</h3>
      <p>
        For those following a low-carb diet, it's important to limit
        carbohydrates from sources such as bread, pasta, and sugar. Instead, opt
        for protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, and healthy fats
        such as nuts and avocados. Be sure to work with a healthcare
        professional to ensure that you're getting all the nutrients you need.
      </p>

      <h3>Mindful Eating and Portion Control</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're following a specific diet or not, practicing mindful
        eating and portion control can help you maintain a healthy weight and
        improve your relationship with food. Some tips for mindful eating
        include eating slowly, savoring your food, and paying attention to your
        hunger and fullness cues. Using a portion control plate or measuring
        cups can also help you keep track of portion sizes.
